# Netflix Movies Data Analysis  

## Overview  
This project analyzes a dataset of **9,827 Netflix movies** to explore trends, genres, ratings, and other insights. It’s my **first step into data analysis and visualization**, where I started by experimenting with data and gradually learned how to clean, analyze, and visualize it.  

## Questions Solved / Key Insights  
Some of the key questions explored in this project:  
- What are the most common genres on Netflix?  
- Which year had the highest number of movie releases?  
- What is the distribution of ratings (Vote_Average) across all movies?  
- Which movies are the most popular?  
- What are the top languages represented?
